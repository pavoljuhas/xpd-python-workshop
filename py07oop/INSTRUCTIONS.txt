Work in your groups:

1) create a CellPhone class that has an owner and can make calls,
as in the example

2) instantiate it twice with two different owners and have them
call each other just as in the example.

3) create a functionality that the ringtone of an instance of the
class can be updated

4) create a functionality that different ringtones may be
associated with different callers

5) create a smartPhone class that extends CellPhone with a chat
feature
   phone a chats phone b
   phone b receives the chat and can read it
   phone b can reply to the chat
   etc..
